Flow

0. Login - The user logs in, or creates an account

1. Map Page - Pick a spot on a map and a distance threshold
    -The app fetches eBird hotspots within the threshold of the selected spot
    -the app suggests the top 10 by species count
!!! -There's got to be a way to overule the app's suggestions
    -The user selects the time period of their trip

----At this point------
    -an ANALYSIS object is instantiated
    -The app scrapes the barchart data for the chosen hot spots
    -the base barchart data is timestamped, and persists in a database
    -the base barchart data is read, and processed structured data is created. These data products are also timestamped and persists
    -if the needed data is both present and current, it's grabbed from the DB, and not scraped


2. Analysis Page - Explore the hotspots, and decide which ones you care about
    -The user turns specific hotspots on and off, and sees how that affects the overall numbers
    -The page calculates the overall odds for every bird, based on active hotspots


----At this point----
    -a TRIP object is instantiated, and logged to a user's account, if they have one
    -

3?. Trip Page
    -




4. Park Page - Exists within the context of a set trip. Tells you what to look out for at a certain park

THE MONK PARAKEET PROBLEM
    Part 1 - General process Flow
    -Find parks
    -pick the parks you want to go to. This is your "trip"

    Part 2 - Monk Parakeets   
    -The idea of a park specialty
    -specialties REQUIRE a specific context of other parks on the route
    -Therefore, specialties are downstream of park selection. 
    -BUT information about specialties can strongly suggest changing the other parks on the route
        -IF alternate parks are kept alive this deep into the process
            -the amount of info blasting the user could be too much
            -The a TRIP is now just a state of an ANALYSIS, which means:
            -There is less data that the app needs to persist.
            -There is more data that needs to be calculated on the fly every time,
        -IF they are not, the process of trimming a park from the trip is clunky and inconvenient
            -A TRIP object is distinct from an ANALYSIS object, and could be smaller in a data sense
            -A TRIP object makes sense as something to persist. Very few calculations would be needed after that point
